# NCMAS-proposals

 - 2022
 - 2021

 The proposals are in the form of a jupyterbook that can be built 
 from the Jupyterbook directory using the script

 ```bash
./build-book.sh 
```

It will also self-deploy to github pages on the gh-pages branch of the repository but this is usually switched off since the proposal is not public.
