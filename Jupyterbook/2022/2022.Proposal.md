**Motivating Questions**

- What is the history, state and ultimate fate of the (Indo-) Australian plate ?
- How are continents built, how do they survive, and when is continental crust destroyed ?
- How are deep mantle processes captured in the geological / sedimentary record ?
- How does lithospheric stress and basin structure influence groundwater flow ?
- How do we include fault evolution (with its short timescale) into long-term tectonics models ?

The dynamic principles underlying plate tectonics are a fundamental aspect of the geological canon for which there is very little quantitative / predictive modelling and many outstanding questions. Plates, plate boundary geometries, plate motions and continental deformation patterns are emergent phenomena resulting from the large-scale mantle flow and strongly non-linear response of the cold, strong lithosphere to mantle stresses. The oceanic plates are, in fact, the cold boundary layer of the global mantle circulation and are entirely recycled into the interior within 200Myr. The continental crust, which is compositionally more buoyant, is deformed but not destroyed by plate processes. As a result, our knowledge of plate-processes in deep geological time depends on our ability to reconstruct the secondary effects of long-dead plates on the continental geological record usually through modelling.

With this in mind, geodynamics, as a discipline, is founded upon numerical modeling to understand the nature of emergent processes given reliable models at the smaller scales, and to open the possibility of simulation at the plate scale through a formal process of data assimilation. Computational geodynamic modelling now plays a central role in emerging conceptual frameworks for the geological and geophysics disciplines. Examples are the way in which subduction, accretion and rollback events have built and deformed the continental lithosphere, and how mountain buildign, seismicity, and plate-driving forces are being reinterpreted in the context of high-resolution dynamic models.


The geodynamics community has developed a number of widely-used, open-source software platforms which are designed specifically to address our very particular requirements. This project is built upon the community-developed `Underworld` software framework which is optimised for parallel HPC (see computational requirements section) and all of the modelling innovations will be released through the `Underworld` model library () and the `Underworld` repository ().

This project develops and extends computational geodynamic modelling at the scale of the lithospheric plates that incorporate mantle flow, plate margin evolution and continental deformation. These models are coupled to landscape evolution, geothermal and groundwater flow models in a step towards an integrated simulation capability for the Australian continent. These models will advance fundamental knowledge of large-scale tectonics, mantle evolution and landscape dynamics. They inform mineral exploration targetting in accretionary terranes, groundwater management of nationally significant aquifers, and tectonic hazard modelling.

%% This study addresses a fundamental question in the dynamics of the mantle and continental lithosphere and how this differs from the plate tectonics paradigm.  The onset of plate tectonics is a key unknown — was it ubiquitous since the early Archean or does the Proterozoic represent the changes associated with the first plate motions ? This question continues to be debated despite being a first order unknown in Earth evolution.
%% Accretion of island arcs and continental fragments represents one of the fundamental mechanisms of continental growth, with numerous examples dating back to Archean time. Most of Alaska and much of western North America consists of accreted terranes. The geological history of Australia can only be understood by analysing the accretionary events which have built the continent. Geologists currently lack a unifying conceptual framework for the process of accretion: this project aims to provide this framework.

%% We are beginning to see that the overall tectonic system in such situations has a simple explanation - with morphological complexities in the crustal architecture occurring in a predictable manner during transient episodes of plate margin disequilibrium. The implication of this research is that subduction zones are persistent and may reconfigure and re-form in preference to jumping backward. Unlike many representation of accretionary margins characterised by multiple subduction events with different polarities (e.g. {cite}`fosterEvolutionStructureLachlan2000`), many of the relationships evident in complex accretionary orogenic belts (e.g. Oroclines) may be explained by a single subduction characterised by transient instabilities. This represents a paradigm shift in interpretation of long-lived accretionary orogenic systems including the Tasmanides, but equally, the Altaids in central Asia.

%% In recent years numerical model outcomes have been  calibrated against a modern example of an accretionary orogenic system (e.g. Moresi 2014). Mantle flow, slab windowing, strike slip deformation, and development of oroclinal crustal geometries are major geodynamic process allowing convergent margins to transition from one stable configuration to another. All of these features are present in the Yakutat. We can study the collision, and plateau subduction process in a Cartesian geometry at first, and then move to geographically constrained models based on the reconstructed plate geometry. The Yakutat terrane is the remnant of an oceanic plateau. It is interpreted to have been accreted onto the margin of north America since the Pliocene, which coincides with a decrease in arc-related magma production in the Wrangall Mountains, making it one of the most juvenile accretionary terranes on the planet.

%% The Yakutat lies adjacent to a large slab window, which is interpreted to have opened during the Miocene {cite}`thorkelsonMantleFlowNorthern2011`. The region is also characterised by large horizontal strike-slip translations, accommodated along major plate margin parallel transpressional fault systems, as well as extremely rapid uplift and mountain building associated with the St Elias Orogen {cite}`christesonYakutatTerraneDramatic2010`} where the plateau is actively subducting. The Yakutat terrane has been subject to intense geophysical study. High resolution plate velocity data derived from GPS data, seismic data that constrains the geometry and composition of the Yakutat terrane and the extent of subduction {cite}`worthingtonCrustalStructureYakutat2012`.

**Significance, originality and innovation**:  Computational geodynamic modelling plays a central role in emerging conceptual frameworks for the geological and geophysics disciplines.  3D dynamic models of the interactions between subduction, collision, rollback and continental/upper plate deformation have changed our understanding of how  the lithosphere is built and reworked. The models developed in this theme will further develop our understanding of the evolution of the Australian continental lithosphere as well as how subduction-zone interactions influence the present-day dynamics of the Indo-Australian Plate.

It is becoming clear that the geological history of  Australia, and other continents, has been profoundly shaped by a long succession of accretionary events.  Collision and accretion contribute to growth of continental lithosphere while also destabilising and re-configuring subduction margins and dramatically reworking arc and back-arc terranes via a spectrum of deformation modes, including crustal shortening, oroclinal folding, escape tectonics, block rotation and extension.

We are beginning to see that the overall tectonic evolution in such situations often has a simple explanation - albeit  with profound morphological complexities in the resultant crustal architecture occurring. Accordingly, geologists are starting to reinterpret the large-scale movements and complex regional architecture in the  context of relatively short-lived,  transient episodes of plate margin disequilibrium, followed by a return to stable subduction retreat. The Australian geodynamics and geological communities have played a central role in this rapid new phase of discovery.

**Societal benefits:** Unlike classic  representations of accretionary margins characterised by multiple  subduction events with different polarities (e.g. {cite}`fosterEvolutionStructureLachlan2000`), many of the relationships evident in complex accretionary orogenic  belts (e.g. Oroclines) may be explained by a single subduction  characterised by transient instabilities. This represents a paradigm  shift in interpretation of long-lived accretionary orogenic systems. Such research has clear societal and economic significance due to the endowment of metals like copper within ancient arc terranes that have been subject to deformation associated with collision, congestion and accretion.

Nevertheless the reconstruction of ancient phases of subduction-congestion, accretion and oroclinal folding remains immensely challenging. The relative rapidity in which subduction margin disequilibrium and reconfiguration occurs mean that analogous settings on the present-day earth are atypical, and under-representative in the geological canon.

**Project goals:**  Enhancing the resolution and breadth of forward numerical models, particularly in terms of the predicted geological expression of congested-subduction transitions will provide scientists with necessary dynamic and kinematic frameworks required to interpret the complex crustal architecture associated with collision and accretion,

Our core  focus in this theme is the geological record immediately following a major accretionary event, because this is the period of significant reconfiguration and modification leading to a new stable convergent  margin. The ultimate outcome of this work is to provide a  unifying  conceptual framework for the 3D evolution of subduction margins in terms of both the underlying dynamic drivers and the resultant geological record.

In practice this requires models that can capture the complex mechanics of the upper plate , where emergent  deformation modes including that strike slip (wrench) faulting, detachment faulting, fold-thrusting and block rotation are resolved. To do this we are bridging earlier models of congested subduction with improved models of lithospheric mechanics, surface processes and sedimentation. Many of these advances involve upscaling results of ultra-high-resolution 2d models (see Subduction Zone Simulation). 3D Models are calibrated against current examples of congested subduction and accretion, including the interaction of the Hikurangi Plateau and the Indo-Australian Plate, as well as the Yakutat Terrane with the North American Plate, providing a robust template for the interpretation of the complex and rich tectonic history of Australia.

The Earth’s continental topography is ephemeral - it reflects the balance of deep convective processes, density variations and elastic stresses in the lithosphere. Changes in convective stresses, erosion of high topography (and deposition of sediments in regions of low topography), relaxation of elastic stresses all contribute to erase the history of surface deformation.

To piece together this history, we propose a modelling approach in which we develop a quantitative, dynamic understanding of the subduction-collision-accretion-subduction cycle using state-of-the-art numerical simulations (Underworld) constrained by geological and geophysical observations. Models that people have developed using Underworld are able to capture the full three-dimensional dynamics of a subducting plate, the mantle flow, deformation of the over-riding plate and accreted terrane, and reconfiguration of the plate boundary — all in a self-consistent manner. Since these models produce a 3D stress field and an associated surface uplift, it is also possible to combine these models with state of the art surface evolutions models (for example Badlands and Quagmire) to connect to the sedimentary record.  

State of the art thermo-mechanical models have become very efficient at testing scenarios of tectonic evolution but uncertainties on the rheologies and the complexity of the underlying physics have so far limited the potential to quantitatively predict uplift and subsidence. Underworld Thermo-mechanical models and Quagmire surface processes models can be fully coupled and have thus  the potential to help us resolve the complex interactions between tectonic and erosion in a wide range of tectonic settings. The models also require careful validation and better integration of field data to prevent error in interpretation. Low temperature thermochronology has been extensively used to quantitatively constrain the thermal histories of rocks. It can provide important information on tectonic uplift (or subsidence) by measuring the erosional (or burial) response and can also map the spatial and temporal pattern of geomorphic response of a landscape. We use the temperature evolution of our coupled thermo-mechanical models with surface processes to predict Apatite fission track data (Ages and Track lengths distributions). The aim is to provide a direct means of comparison with actual empirical thermochronometric data which will allow different model scenarios and/or model parameter choices to be robustly tested.

Highly-parallel, basin-scale numerical models of groundwater storage and flow patterns will be constrained by  observations from borehole temperatures, hydraulic pressure and recharge estimates. Ensembles of models within a data-assimilation formalism will simulate the condition of the aquifer in response to changing conditions and provide a means to evaluate the effect of natural changes and any proposals to modify groundwater usage patterns. The “Whole of Basin” concept is a recognition that interactions within and even between basins make it necessary to build predictive models at a basin scale with billions of degrees of freedom.

This project will target two basin systems in Australia: the Sydney-Gunnedah-Bowen Basins and the Great Artesian Basin which are both mixed use basins that are of critical importance as sources of groundwater and for which there are readily available 3D geological models in electronic form that characterise the large-scale geological structure and ongoing monitoring programmes with Geoscience Australia (GA) and state-based Geological Surveys.

**Significance, originality and innovation**:  These are novel coupled groundwater-thermal numerical model that can resolve the regional and local flow patterns of the Sydney-Gunnedah-Bowen and Great Artesian Basins at exceptionally high resolution in 3D. These models will be constrained from borehole observations of groundwater recharge and temperature gradients using a Bayesian inversion framework where we initially assume that the 3D structural model is exact and invert for the permeability and thermal conductivity, heat production rate of each lithology identified in the model, and the basal thermal condition. We use a differential evolution algorithm for finding the global minimum of the misfit which is one of a family of genetic algorithms and is more efficient than traditional Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In differential evolution, multiple starting points are initialised from a Latin hypercube and their local probability space is explored using MCMC and these compete to find the global minimum. A multi-resolution approach to the inversion is required to make this problem tractable. These models are a step towards forecasting of aquifer responses to recharge trends from climate variability and change, and to changes in usage.

**Societal benefits:** Australia’s groundwater-bearing basins are indispensable not just for economic reasons but because they underpin the cultural, spiritual and religious way of life for many different populations across an arid continent. Ordens et al. (2020) capture this perfectly in reference to the Great Artesian Basin: “The GAB’s ground surface is characterized by semi-arid regions with land uses that often rely on access to groundwater, and it is considered the lifeblood of much of Australia’s interior for Indigenous peoples (the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, who are the Traditional Owners of the land), and for landowners, agriculture and industry. Water use in the region allows for A$12.8 billion in economic activity annually. The GAB aquifers support many springs, which are associated with important groundwater-dependent ecosystems and Indigenous livelihood, cultural values, traditions and spirituality.”  Our tools will help to clarify the likely effect of specific decisions (or taking no action) on the state of the aquifers of the Great Artesian Basin and the Sydney-Gunnedah-Bowen basins system.

Results of a 2D simple shear model showing earthquake cycles. The stress recorded in the middle part of the fault shows it linearly evolves from 0 to the yield point of a fault  (~1.2 MPa), and then drops to 0.4 MPa after the earthquake event (Top left); then the stress gradually increases to the yield point again in ~15 years during the interseismic stage. The maximum slip rate of 1010 cm/yr happens during the earthquake event and drops to 10s cm/yr during interseismic stages (lower left). The corresponding time step changes from 10$^{-1}$ year to <10$^{-7}$ year (0.1 second) and effective viscosity from 10$^{17}$ Pas to < 10$^9$ Pas, respectively (Top right and lower right).

%%The geodynamic numerical modelling software `Underworld` is originally designed for long-term visco-plastic deformations of the planet with a time step of 10,000s-100,000s years. The elastic mode is also available in `Underworld`, and the visco-elastic(-plastic) deformation depends on the observation time step. Generally, the elastic component requires the time step to be less than the Maxwell relaxation time (100s-1,000s years) of crustal material. However, co-seismic fault slip happens in <10s seconds. The fault co-seismic slip is typically assumed to be governed by the Rate-state frictional relationship. The commonly used software for long-term tectonic deformations averages out the co-seismic fault displacement into thousands to tens of thousands of years, and neglects near-fault damages of earthquakes, therefore may not be able to decipher fault activities in detail. The softwares simulating earthquake rupture dynamics may not have a good estimation of background stress due to long-term tectonic deformations. This study is aimed to fill the gap between long-term and short-term deformations.To implement the rate-state frictional relationship in `Underworld`, the adaptive time step from 10s years  to <1 second is required.

**Significance, originality and innovation**: Although the tectonic context of megathrust earthquakes is well understood, questions about the spectrum of slip behaviour (e.g. slow slip events that last for weeks to months), the potential of megathrust precursory activity, and dynamic interaction between interplate and intraplate domains (e.g. outer-rise faulting) are fundamental  questions in plate boundary research.

The geodynamic numerical modelling software `Underworld` is originally  designed for long-term visco-plastic deformations of the planet with a typical  time step of kyrs to several 10s of kyrs. In this modelling framework the evolutionary history of the mantle-lithosphere system represents a sequence of quasi-static configurations, with a purely kinematic time evolution.

This kind of approach to long-term tectonic deformations averages out the co-seismic fault displacement into thousands to tens of thousands of years, and  neglects near-fault damage of earthquakes, therefore may not be able to decipher fault activities in detail.

On the other hand, the typical computational approaches to simulating  earthquake rupture dynamics may not provide a robust estimation of background stress due to long-term tectonic deformations. This study is aimed to  fill the gap between long-term and short-term deformations.

The key ingredients for seismic cycle modelling within a continuum geodynamics framework are tectonic loading, elastic stress buildup/relaxation and a rate-dependent friction formulation. Elastic deformations are currently  implemented in `Underworld`, based on a particle-based scheme for the transport of elastic stress tensor components, and has been extensively benchmarked.

Bridging the quasi-static loading stages, with the comparably fast instabilities that occur under rate dependent friction, requires an adaptive time-stepping approach. For numerical stability it becomes necessary to consider inertial forces. These computational details have been integrated with the `Underworld` software in the last year

**Project goals:** The main goals of this research are to explore subduction seismic cycles within a 3d setup, allowing for along strike dynamic interactions. The interaction of megathrust earthquake cycles with stress and  deformation in the upper plate and slab will also be investigated.
