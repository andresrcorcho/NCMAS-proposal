In this project the computational backbone is provided by highly parallel solution methods, efficient solvers and particle-based techniques to achieve levels of resolution and rheological fidelity which are a step above the standard Finite Element Methods that use only mesh-based representations. The Underworld developers have concentrated on improving the fidelity of models available to the community and demonstrated that a general code is able to reproduce state-of-the-art studies for specific processes (such as the subduction zone interface - Garel et al, 2014) into general models that can be reused. For example, see the figure below (supplied by the Underworld development team).

Our proposed approach concentrates on understanding the dynamic evolution of plate boundaries in four dimensions with very careful attention to the details of the rheology and numerical approximations at the sub-grid scale. We are therefore confident that the characteristic patterns that have been reported in numerical models do have meaningful analogues in the geological record.

In this project we propose to combine expertise in algorithm development, parallel computing and computational physics alongside domain expertise. We do this in collaboration with the Underworld development team and using the open-source Underworld software. Any novel computational developments that emerge from this project will, after publication, be made available to the community by contributing them to the Underworld community github site where new code can be submitted for review. Developments in the surface process modelling domain can be contributed to the Quagmire team in the same manner.


%% The following almost certainly has to go ...

## Underworld suite development:

The Underworld and Quagmire codes are a community effort that benefits from all contributions made to the codebase by collaborating teams. In this project, we undertake to contribute all developments to the Underworld open-source projects. In particular, there is an attempt to refresh the solver architecture of Underworld which is of benefit to the community and we intend to participate in this effort. We are requesting 200kSU/q (split between Raijin and Magnus) to support this community exercise.

## Subduction Zone Simulation

This builds upon recent work on slab dynamics and stress distribution / seismicity ({cite}`sandifordImprovingSubductionInterface2019, sandifordGeometricControlsFlat2019,carluccioImpactVeryWeak2019`) that was published recently and for which all model files are openly available. These have an expected requirement of 500-750 kSU / quarter in line with recent usage. The work in the coming year is to look at 3D effects on topography and deformation in the over-riding plate which will require a further 500-750 kSU/quarter.



## Continental Deformation / Congested Subduction

Large-scale models have been used to understand how mantle flow and plate motions produce identifiable signatures in the continental geological record {cite}`yangContrastedEastAsia2019`. We propose to extend this work with high resolution studies of Alaska and New Zealand in order to understand the response of the continental lithosphere to boundary forces and looking at three dimensional deformation patterns with localisation requiring very high resolution. Together we estimate 150-250kSU/q for this component of the work plan.

## Destroying Craton

{cite}`cooperStructuralEvolutionDeep2017` concluded that destruction of cratonic lithosphere can be directed and magnified by both the cratonic shape and adjacent subduction using 3D instantaneous numerical regional scale models. We proposed here to understand the time dependent nature of the interaction between the stable, long-lined cratonic lithosphere and transient, highly deforming active subduction zones.

%% Haibin's work needs ...

We have tested 2D models (Fig. 1), and found reasonable results.  We plan 3D models of such implementation in Underworld for the next year 2022. As the short-term coseismic slip simulation requires extremely high mesh resolutions (<100m; the long-term 3D model generally only needs <3000m in mesh resolution), we thus apply for at least 250 ksu per season for 3D simulations like this.
