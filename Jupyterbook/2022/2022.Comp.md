In this project the computational backbone is provided by the `Underworld` suite of geodynamic modeling codes which boast highly parallel solution methods, efficient solvers and particle-based techniques to achieve levels of resolution and rheological fidelity which are a step above the standard Finite Element Methods where purely mesh-based representations are used. The `Underworld` developers, with the help of the user community,  have concentrated on improving the fidelity of models and demonstrated that a general code is able to reproduce state-of-the-art studies for specific processes into general models that the community can build upon
(such as the subduction zone interface - Garel et al, 2014 shown in {numref}`Subduction2022` - supplied by the `Underworld` development team).

Underworld is based upon the Lagrangian-Integration-Point finite element method {cite}`moresiLagrangianIntegrationPoint2003, moresiMantleConvectionModeling2002` which was designed for modelling the dynamics of complex fluids - materials in which there are both large deformations and the constitutive laws are dependent upon the accumulated strain. Deformations of the solid Earth fall into the category of complex fluids because rocks and ice are viscoelastic, develop anisotropic fabrics as they deform, and, as they approach failure, tend to suffer feedbacks between strength and deformation that result in shear localization.

`Underworld` was designed to study a wide variety of geological systems including: thermochemical convection applied to the cycle of continental drift {cite}`lenardicRoleMobileBelts2000`, the dynamics of the subducted lithosphere {cite}`schellartCenozoicTectonicsWestern2010, schellartEvolutionDiversitySubduction2007,sandifordFingerprintsFlexureSlab2020`, instablities of the mantle lithosphere {cite}`beallDrippingDelaminationRange2017, cooperEffectsContinentalConfiguration2013, farringtonInteractions3DMantle2010`,  orocline formation {cite}`moresiDynamicsContinentalAccretion2014, smithFormationOroclinesBuckling2021a`, the dynamics of mantle plumes, {cite}`bettsGeodynamicsOceanicPlateau2015, meriauxMantlePlumeDynamics2020`, rift development {cite}`korchinskiNumericalInvestigationDeepcrust2018, mondyRoleAsthenosphericFlow2018`, shear banding {cite}`lemialeShearBandingAnalysis2008, moresiIncompressibleViscousFormulations2007`, fault formation and evolution {cite}`sharplesStylesRiftingFault2015, yangFaultSpacingContinental2019`

Lagrangian-Integration Point methods are a variant of the standard finite element method in which numerical integration of the weak form takes place using sample points that are transported using the fluid velocity. The mesh is not required to follow the fluid deformation (though, as with Arbitrary Lagrangian, Eulerian methods, it can follow some aspects of the deformation such as boundary motions if that proves to be convenient). Unknowns are computed on the finite element mesh and are used to update history variables that are transported on the "swarm" of Lagrangian integration points.

Decoupling mesh optimisation from fluid motion makes it possible to choose meshes for which efficient partial differential equation solvers are available. For example, `Underworld` makes extensive use of geometrical multigrid solvers on hierarchical grids for the Stokes equation. The mesh can be decomposed for parallel problems without the need to update the partitioning to follow fluid motion. When adaptive meshing is required, there are still advantages to the Lagrangian integration Point approach because there is no requirement to interpolate history variables between meshes.

% Note - I am writing this as if we are already completely moved to UW3 !!

Parallelism in `Underworld` is built upon `PETSc`  (REF), a widely-used framework that integrates many other tools and provides classes to support linear algebra, mesh construction and partitioning, finite element computation, particle swarm management etc. The `PETSc` API is written to enforce efficient parallelism but is relatively low level and targeted for use by computational mathematicians. `Underworld` provides a high-level interface to `PETSc` and is specialised for geoscientists.

The user interface for `Underworld` is written as a `python` wrapper around `PETSc`, making full use of pythons object-oriented programming model to hide the robust mathematical implementation from the typical geodynamic modeller. The python layer is used to orchestrate the `PETSc` objects resulting in a very light computational footprint that supports rapid model creation. In the scaling discussion below, it can be seen that the only meaningful impact of the python wrapper on computational performance is a one-off penalty at launch when the python libraries need to be imported.

% Our proposed approach concentrates on understanding the dynamic evolution of plate boundaries in four dimensions with very careful attention to the details of the rheology and numerical approximations at the sub-grid scale. We are therefore confident that the characteristic patterns that have been reported in numerical models do have meaningful analogues in the geological record.

% In this project we propose to combine expertise in algorithm development, parallel computing and computational physics alongside domain expertise. We do this in collaboration with the Underworld development team and using the open-source Underworld software. Any novel computational developments that emerge from this project will, after publication, be made available to the community by contributing them to the Underworld community github site where new code can be submitted for review. Developments in the surface process modelling domain can be contributed to the Quagmire team in the same manner.

## Scaling

The following results are based on `Underworld` 2.11 scaling tests on Gadi and Magnis performed in Q3 2021. The reference model chosen for this scaling showcase is a extended 3D stokes flow: Analytic Solution SolDB3D. Q1P0 elements were used and a fixed solver iteration count for solving the saddle point problem. We extended this model adding extra routines (swarm advection and the advection-diffusion equation solver) to capture all the main algorithms used in a typical thermo-mechanical model by `Underworld`. The results are split into Strong and Weak scaling results.


**Strong scaling**


{numref}`Strong-Scaling` shows various resolution runs performed over a range of CPU numbers (nproc). The y-axis is measured in service units to capture the cost of using the compute resources. For ideal scaling one would expect families of flat lines as doubling the amount of CPUs should result in halving the runtime; yielding a constant Service Unit cost.

**Weak scaling**


{numref}`Weak-Scaling`  shows the effect of running the same amount of work (elements count in the legend) per CPU constant but increasing the number of processor CPUs used. This investigates the parallel efficiency of the code.

%% Unfortunately we were only able to run these scaling models once (sometimes twice) due to low time allocation of the 2 HPC facilities. Ideally, we would repeat each model configuration at least 3 times and take an average model time to generate more statistically sound results.

These results all scripts used to run and analyse the results are stored here: https://github.com/underworldcode/scaling_scripts

### Underworld suite development:

The Underworld and Quagmire codes are a community effort that benefits from all contributions made to the codebase by collaborating teams. In this project, we undertake to contribute all developments to the Underworld open-source projects. In particular, there is an attempt to refresh the solver architecture of Underworld which is of benefit to the community and we intend to participate in this effort. We are requesting 200kSU/q (split between Gadi and Magnus) to support this community exercise.

%%% Magnus - are we still requesting time on Magnus?

%%% Requests for time are given in the second section of this proposal document




### Congested Subduction / Continental Deformation (Theme 1 & 2)

Large-scale models have been used to understand how mantle flow and plate motions produce identifiable signatures in the continental geological record {cite}`yangContrastedEastAsia2019`. We propose to extend this work with high resolution studies of Alaska and New Zealand in order to understand the response of the continental lithosphere to boundary forces and looking at three dimensional deformation patterns with localisation requiring very high resolution. Together we estimate 150-250kSU/q for this component of the work plan.

### Destroying Craton (Theme 1)

{cite}`cooperStructuralEvolutionDeep2017` concluded that destruction of cratonic lithosphere can be directed and magnified by both the cratonic shape and adjacent subduction using 3D instantaneous numerical regional scale models. We proposed here to understand the time dependent nature of the interaction between the stable, long-lined cratonic lithosphere and transient, highly deforming active subduction zones.

%% Haibin's work needs ...

We have tested 2D models (Fig. 1), and found reasonable results.  We plan 3D models of such implementation in Underworld for the next year 2022. As the short-term coseismic slip simulation requires extremely high mesh resolutions (<100m; the long-term 3D model generally only needs <3000m in mesh resolution), we thus apply for at least 250 ksu per season for 3D simulations like this.

### Obliquity in the evolution of collisional margins (Theme 1 & 2)

The main purpose of our 3D numerical simulations is to simulate how oblique arc-continent collision affects the collision style, the lithospheric-mantle dynamics, and the associated strain-stress evolution in the continental plate. The typical dimension of our 3D Underworld models is 6000 x 800 x 3000 km mapped over a computational grid of 256x96x96 elements. Thus, our models run at a spatial resolution of 23.4 x 8.3 x 31.2 km and include ~1.0 billion tracers. In order to simulate all stages of oblique arc-continent collision we need to run each experiment more than 500 calculation steps in order to achieve 30 My (million years) of history. We need to run multiple simulations using different obliquities as we are interested in making a sensitivity test of the impact of the angle of collision parameter in the evolution of oblique arc-continent collision.


### Subduction Zone Simulation (Theme 4)

This builds upon recent work on slab dynamics and stress distribution / seismicity ({cite}`sandifordImprovingSubductionInterface2019, sandifordGeometricControlsFlat2019,carluccioImpactVeryWeak2019`) that was published recently and for which all model files are openly available. These have an expected requirement of 500-750 kSU / quarter in line with recent usage. The work in the coming year is to look at 3D effects on topography and deformation in the over-riding plate which will require a further 500-750 kSU/quarter.
