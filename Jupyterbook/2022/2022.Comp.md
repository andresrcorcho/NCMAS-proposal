Left: Underworld reproduction of ultra-high resolution subduction models (Garel et al 2014) that now form a part of the model component library for studying the influence of dynamic processes on continental deformation (From   {cite}`sandifordGeometricControlsFlat2019` ). Right: Models applied to flat slab subduction that predict the stress distribution and regions of seismicity as the slab subducts.

This project makes extensive use of the `Underworld` suite of software applications which include `UWgeodynamics` for plate-scale problems, `Underwater` for groundwater flow models, and `Quagmire` for landscape evolution models.



## Underworld suite development:

The Underworld and Quagmire codes are a community effort that benefits from all contributions made to the codebase by collaborating teams. In this project, we undertake to contribute all developments to the Underworld open-source projects. In particular, there is an attempt to refresh the solver architecture of Underworld which is of benefit to the community and we intend to participate in this effort. We are requesting 200kSU/q (split between Raijin and Magnus) to support this community exercise.
