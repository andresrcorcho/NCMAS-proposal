  abstract = {We present three 3D numerical models of deep subduction where buoyant material from an oceanic plateau and a plume interact with the overriding plate to assess the influence on subduction dynamics, trench geometry, and mechanisms for plateau accretion and continental growth. Transient instabilities of the convergent margin are produced, resulting in: contorted trench geometry; trench migration parallel with the plate margin; folding of the subducting slab and orocline development at the convergent margin; and transfer of the plateau to the overriding plate. The presence of plume material beneath the oceanic plateau causes flat subduction above the plume, resulting in a ``bowed'' shaped subducting slab. In plateau-only models, plateau accretion at the edge of the overriding plate results in trench migration around the edge of the plateau before subduction is re-established directly behind the trailing edge of the plateau. The plateau shortens and some plateau material subducts. The presence of buoyant plume material beneath the oceanic plateau has a profound influence on the behaviour of the convergent margin. In the plateau~+~plume model, plateau accretion causes rapid trench advance. Plate convergence is accommodated by shearing at the base of the plateau and shortening in the overriding plate. The trench migrates around the edge of the plateau and subduction is re-established well behind the trailing edge of the plateau, effectively embedding the plateau into the overriding plate. A slab window forms beneath the accreted plateau and plume material is transferred from the subducting plate to the overriding plate through the window. In all of the models, the subduction zone maintains a relatively stable configuration away from the buoyancy anomalies within the downgoing plate. The models provide a dynamic context for plateau and plume accretion in Phanerozoic accretionary orogenic systems such as the East China Orogen and the Central Asian Orogen (Altiads), which are characterised by accreted ophiolite complexes with diverse geochemical affinities, and a protracted evolution of accretion of exotic terranes including oceanic plateau and terranes with plume origins.},

This process could carve and shape the cratons, leading to conditions that impact the overall (in)stability of the lithosphere. We use three-dimensional geodynamic models to investigate how subduction-driven directed flow interacts with cratonic lithosphere of differing shape, concluding that the margin shape controls both channelization of flow around the craton as well as the potential for destruction. While the simulations show that all craton shapes aid in channelization, the cratons with straight vertical margins are the most resistant to deformation, and the cratons with gradually thickening margins are less resistant to deformation. The dependence on shape could contribute to the progressive removal of cratonic lithosphere along its margin in a runaway process until a more stable vertical margin shape evolves.},

  abstract = {Continental lithosphere houses the oldest and thickest regions of the Earth's surface. Locked within this deep and ancient rock record lies invaluable information about the dynamics that has shaped and continue to shape the planet. Much of that history has been dominated by the forces of plate tectonics which has repeatedly assembled super continents together and torn them apart - the Wilson Cycle. While the younger regions of continental lithosphere have been subject to deformation driven by plate tectonics, it is less clear whether the ancient, stable cores formed and evolved from similar processes. New insight into continental formation and evolution has come from remarkable views of deeper lithospheric structure using enhanced seismic imaging techniques and the increase in large volumes of broadband data. Some of the most compelling observations are that the continental lithosphere has a broad range in thicknesses ({$<$}100 to {$>$}300km), has complex internal structure, and that the thickest portion appears to be riddled with seismic discontinuities at depths between \textasciitilde 80 and \textasciitilde 130km. These internal structural features have been interpreted as remnants of lithospheric formation during Earth's early history. If they are remnants, then we can attempt to investigate the structure present in the deep lithosphere to piece together information about early Earth dynamics much as is done closer to the surface. This would help delineate between the differing models describing the dynamics of craton formation, particularly whether they formed in the era of modern plate tectonics, a transitional mobile-lid tectonic regime, or are the last fragments of an early, stagnant-lid planet. Our review paper (re)introduces readers to the conceptual definitions of the lithosphere and the complex nature of the upper boundary layer, then moves on to discuss techniques and recent seismological observations of the continental lithosphere. We then review geodynamic models and hypotheses for the formation of the continental lithosphere through time and implications for the formation and preservation of deep structure. These are contrasted with the dynamical picture of modern day continental growth during lateral accretion of juvenile crust with reference to examples from the Australian Tasmanides and the Alaskan accretionary margin.},

  abstract = {Subduction zones become congested when they try to consume buoyant, exotic crust. The accretionary mountain belts (orogens) that form at these convergent plate margins have been the principal sites of lateral continental growth through Earth's history. Modern examples of accretionary margins are the North American Cordilleras and southwest Pacific subduction zones. The geologic record contains abundant accretionary orogens, such as the Tasmanides1, along the eastern margin of the supercontinent Gondwana, and the Alta\"ides, which formed on the southern margin of Laurasia2. In modern and ancient examples of long-lived accretionary orogens, the overriding plate is subjected to episodes of crustal extension and back-arc basin development, often related to subduction rollback3 and transient episodes of orogenesis and crustal shortening4,5,6,7, coincident with accretion of exotic crust. Here we present three-dimensional dynamic models that show how accretionary margins evolve from the initial collision, through a period of plate margin instability, to re-establishment of a stable convergent margin. The models illustrate how significant curvature of the orogenic system develops, as well as the mechanism for tectonic escape of the back-arc region. The complexity of the morphology and the evolution of the system are caused by lateral rollback of a tightly arcuate trench migrating parallel to the plate boundary and orthogonally to the convergence direction. We find geological and geophysical evidence for this process in the Tasmanides of eastern Australia, and infer that this is a recurrent and global phenomenon.},

  abstract = {The relationship between intraslab seismicity and the dynamics of subduction is a subject of ongoing debate. Uncertainty surrounds (1) the extent to which the stress regime associated with slab earthquakes reflects the driving/resisting forces of subduction, or more localised processes such as metamorphic or thermo-elastic volume change, and (2) the relative contribution of uniform (stretching/shortening) and flexural (bending/buckling) deformation modes in slabs. Because variations in slab curvature are very clear in subduction zones with flat slab segments, such settings allow for assessment of the relationship between slab geometry, bending and seismicity. Using a numerical model that reproduces published flat slab geometries we show how bending rates, which are dominated by the advective component, relate to downdip curvature gradients. Based on published slab geometries, we show that the patterns of seismicity in the Peruvian and Mexican flat slabs, vary systematically with slab curvature gradient. Seismicity is restricted to regions colder than about 600\textdegree C. This means that only the upper half of flat slab bending zones are expressed seismically, providing the appearance of a uniform extensional regime.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Numerical subduction models often implement an entrained weak layer (WL) to facilitate decoupling of the slab and upper plate. This approach is attractive in its simplicity, and can provide stable, asymmetric subduction systems that persist for many tens of millions of years. In this study we undertake a methodological analysis of the WL approach, and use these insights to guide improvements to the implementation. The issue that primarily motivates the study is the emergence of significant spatial and temporal thickness variations within the WL. We show that these variations are mainly the response to volumetric flux gradients, caused by the change in boundary conditions as the WL material enters and exits the zone of decoupling. The time taken to reach a quasi-equilibrium thickness profile will depend on the total plate convergence, and is around 7\&thinsp;Myr for the models presented here. During the transient stage, width variations along the WL can exceed 4\texttimes, which may impact the effective strength of the interface, through physical effects if the rheology is linear, or simply if the interface becomes inadequately numerically resolved. The transient stage also induces strong sensitivity to model resolution. By prescribing a variable-thickness WL at the outset of the model, and by controlling the limits of the layer thickness during the model evolution, we find improved stability and resolution convergence of the models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {East Asia and South America have both experienced long-term subduction since at least the Jurassic, but they have had contrasting tectonic evolutions since the Late Cretaceous. East Asia was dominated by extensional tectonics with many marginal sea basins forming during the Cenozoic while South America was dominated by compressional tectonics building the Andean mountains. The mechanism controlling this contrast in tectonic style on opposite sides of the Pacific has been unclear. We suggest that the deep mantle flow revealed by seismic tomography, plate reconstructions, and geodynamic models contributed to the pan-Pacific tectonic disparity. Our geodynamic models suggest that the Atlantic Ocean opening plays an important role in promoting compression-dominated tectonics and Andean building along the South American margin by allowing fast trench-ward motion of South America. On the other hand, the long-standing downwelling flow beneath the interior of Asia since Asian assembly in the Paleozoic and the early Mesozoic helps to inhibit Atlantic-type ocean opening in Asia and restrain trench-ward motion of East Asia, promoting extension-dominated tectonics along the Asian margin. The restrained trench-ward motion suggests a low probability of flat-slab subduction occurrence in East Asia during the late Mesozoic.},
